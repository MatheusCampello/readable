# MyReads Project
This project is to oranize a list of Books in different shelves. A User can categorize his or hers books in three different shelves, one for Currently Reading books, another for Want to Read books and the final one is for the books that are already read. 

Another funcionality is that an User can search in a backend of books to find a specific book that they want to categorize.
